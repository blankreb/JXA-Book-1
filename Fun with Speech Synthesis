JXA Script: Fun with  Speech Synthesis
// Note: Ensure that the Samantha voice is installed and available on your macOS system.
// Check system settings under System Voice to see available voices.

// Access the Standard Additions for speech synthesis
standardAdditions = Application.currentApplication()
standardAdditions.includeStandardAdditions = true

// Prepare a message to speak
message = "Hello, this is Samantha speaking through your Mac."

// Using the 'say' command with a Siri voice
standardAdditions.say(message, {
    using: 'Samantha',   // Specify a voice
    pitch: 50,       // Set the pitch (0 to 100)
    rate: 200        // Set the speaking rate (words per minute)
})
